# Printer-Pi-DCP-115C
Cups network printserver with a Raspberry Pi 2/3, Brother DCP-115C and 433Mhz wireless sockets. With the following upgrade my old reliable Brother has now basic network printer functionalities and is more environmentally friendly.

## Getting Started
You should have some basic experience in creating projects with a Raspberry Pi, Linux, GPIO wiring and the related stuff. I would **not** recommend to try this as your first project. The most difficult part was to get the Brother DCP-115C running on a raspberry Pi because there are no drivers as ARM binaries from Brother available, only x86.
